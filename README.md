# NoChunkUnload
A simple 1.8.9 Forge mod to prevent the client from unloading chunks randomly  
Doesn't prevent chunk from being unloaded due to the render distance*  
  
### Template used
[forge-mixin-example](https://github.com/mouse0w0/forge-mixin-example)  

### Reasons for this mode
Chunks unloading was getting quite annoying on the "Mineplex Backup project"
